## Tips & Tricks

- **Search Functionality**: Use partial names or contact numbers in search fields
- **Calendar Navigation**: Click dates to view/add appointments for that date
- **Color Coding**: Different colored appointment cards indicate status and diagnosis availability
- **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple appointments when generating invoices for batch billing
- **Export Files**: All certificates, reports, and invoices save as `.txt` files in the application directory

## Troubleshooting

**"No such table" error**: The database will automatically create tables on first run

**Calendar not showing dates**: Ensure the mindate is set to today or earlier in appointments

**Appointments not saving**: Verify that patient and doctor are selected before saving

**Login failed**: Check default credentials or verify database permissions

- Advanced reporting with charts
